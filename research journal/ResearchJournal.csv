left,zolfaqqari,"Internet Artist, graphic composition","zolfaqqari is a mostly generative artist and his works is recognized by his minimal geometric approach to the art. also out of generative world he has artistic experiences in creating works including complex forms and compositions. In this artist's work, I see three core elements: points, lines, and surfaces. The circles of different sizes are ""points"", which are scattered in an orderly manner on the ""lines"" that are intertwined like a grid; and the various colored areas outlined by these lines constitute a rich ""surface"". I plan to apply this logic of point-line-surface to my web design, such as using color blocks to divide different content sections, and then using simple lines to strengthen the page structure and hierarchy.",FSa97P1XsAMkUxh.jpeg,,zolfaqqari's generative art,,https://exchange.art/zolfaqqari/nfts,"ComputerArt, Artist", 
left,Pulse Room,"Artist, Mexico, interactive installations","Rafael Lozano-Hemmer’s Pulse Room consists of 300 incandescent light bulbs suspended from a ceiling grid, and an electronic device that captures the cardiac rhythm of a viewer, which is then translated into a light signal. When a viewer places their hands on the captor located near the gallery entrance, their pulse is recorded and transmitted to a single bulb in front of them, which then begins to pulsate in time with the recorded heartbeat. In this interactive art installation, the concept of ""pulse"" - that is, heartbeat - deeply inspired me and became the core of my final project: I plan to use heartbeat signals as triggers to visualize the rhythm of life. In the original work, the artist presents the rhythm of the pulse through the flashing of lights. I really appreciate this concept of integrating installation art with the beauty of human life breath.",Rafael_Lozano-Hemmer_Pace_07.jpg,https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmacm.org%2Fen%2Fcollections%2Foeuvre%2Fpulse-room%2F&psig=AOvVaw0cEfNTJxRBOri70HbjwtBU&ust=1746956116863000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCIi8w-jMmI0DFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ,"Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Pulse Room","Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Pulse Topology, 2021",https://www.lozano-hemmer.com/pulse_room.php,"CreativeCoding, Installation, Artist, Interactive",

Human presence prevents the rain from falling, creating a unique atmosphere and exploring how human relationships to each other and to nature are increasingly mediated through technology. What really touched me about this work is not the technology or concept behind it, but the extremely high aesthetic value and appeal it shows, which made me deeply realize that interactive design can also shine in the aesthetic level. In addition, one of the fun things about interactive design is that it can simulate and fully visualize a substance that does not exist in the real world - just like the rain in the picture that seems real but does not really fall.","RAIN+ROOM,+2012++.jpeg","RAIN+ROOM,+2012++2.jpeg",Rain Room,Rain Room,https://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/rain-room,"water, injection moulded tiles, solenoid valves, pressure regulators, custom software, 3D tracking cameras, steel beams, water management system",

As a member of the band, many of her posters are related to independent music, punk, and experimental art. Although this poster belongs to the category of graphic design and is different from interactive devices in media and form, it has brought me abundant creative inspiration. When I started web design, I hope to learn from its free and unrestrained and childlike expression. As the teacher said in the week 2 interactive media class - current web design is prone to homogenization, designers should be brave enough to break the convention and pursue a more dynamic and individual layout - I am drawing the unrestrained creative spirit from this poster. The posters also have a hint of rebellious spirit.",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cbab67865a7075ee495c686/1718707600866-GMLQ72AAON9ZKN3HGY5R/Channel_April+9_A3.jpg?format=2500w,,"Gig poster, 2023",,https://www.carolyn-hawkins.com/,"poster, graphic, colour, music",
left,Josef Müller-Brockmann “swiss style”,"swiss style, graphic design, typography","Müller-Brockmann is probably one of the most influential graphic designers in the history. His work is always taught, studied and published. It is certainly the figurehead of Swiss graphic design (which also takes the name of international style). His work is influenced by Bauhaus and constructivism. Typography and geometry are predominant. His compositions are based on very ""rigid"" grids which will be his trademark. An economical and rational style! This poster is a classic example of Swiss-style design: its rigorous grid system, minimalist composition, and pure black and white color scheme gave me new inspiration. It is completely different from the previous reference works. it especially influenced my project 2B web design, which injected a distinct sense of order and simpliness into the entire visual scheme.",d068d84ec96cc1c08890b4fa6adda022.jpg,,beethoven poster,,https://www.grapheine.com/en/graphic-design-en/graphic-designer-muller-brockmann-swiss-style,"graphic design, composition, gird",

Omid Nemalhabib takes ""rootless roots"" as the core concept, combining the complex narrative of Persian miniatures, Dutch minimalism and the scar aesthetics of war ruins to form a ""broken geometric divinity"" style. This poster gave me a deeper inspiration in font design. Designers shape the font itself as a shape, which not only conveys information, but also becomes an important element of the picture composition, thus affecting the overall graphic layout. After seeing it, I began to think: How should I select and use fonts in my web design? How can the shape, thickness, and spacing of these fonts create a harmonious and tense visual relationship with the background and each other?",93a71a7be498c0e0eff8033342772fed.jpg,,poster,,,"graphic design, composition, typographic",
leftDoubleImage,Thijs Biersteker,"interaction media, installation","The artist is known for his ecological artworks that create awareness about the current problems we’re facing. This art installation is called MB>CO2, a machine that shows the actual impact that online activities are having on the environment. There are three monitors showing a different activity on each one like a Zoom call, Spotify playlist, Netflix viewing, etc. They are then hooked up to a mini-computer which shows the calculations of the emissions for each of these actions. In addition, this installation creates a harmonious scene of industrial interaction and natural growth by connecting plant ecology with human social activities. Its design concept inspired me deeply: Can the same ""symbiotic"" rhythm be simulated in digital interfaces? I imagine mapping data such as user clicks, page stays, and interaction frequency into a visual metaphor of plant growth - every time a visitor operates on the page, it is like injecting nutrients into the plant, allowing the branches and leaves to gradually spread and the buds to slowly bloom. With this, I hope to create a data-driven dynamic effect that is both interesting and immersive in my web design, so that users can personally experience the wonderful symbiosis between people and interfaces, and between people and nature.",1.webp,1.webp,MB>CO2,,https://www.yankodesign.com/2022/05/25/installation-shows-how-data-usage-affects-our-ecological-footprint/,"interactive media, installation",
leftDoubleImage,Universal Everything,"interaction media, installation","Universal Everything’s contribution to the Barbican’s AI: More Than Human exhibition is an interactive digital work called Future You. As you arrive, a mirror-like screen captures your movements and projects back a primitive, synthetic form that learns and adapts in real time. Over the course of your interaction, this digital double refines your gestures into a more agile, “enhanced” version of yourself. Each encounter produces a bespoke visual outcome—one of 47,000 unique possible variations. What attracts me most about this installation art is that it abstracts the human body into a geometric structure, and gives flexible activity at those ""joints"" to connect with human limbs. This design inspired me to deeply integrate human movement with mechanical movement in my final project: not only can body movements drive mechanical devices, but also achieve human-machine synchronous cooperation, thus surpassing the traditional ""button trigger"" interaction and exploring more possibilities.

Although this web design looks minimalist, it played a key role in my 2B project.

An exploration of the eternal within the fleeting, developed through AI-customized LoRas and “Symbiosis”, an interactive generation system. I am interested in this installation because it cleverly combines classical aesthetics with modern abstractionism, and allows the audience to no longer be a passive spectator, but a ""witness"" of the passage of time. I am particularly impressed by the installation with flowers as the theme: the blooming and withering of petals dynamically presents the traces of time, and also reveals the profound connection between ""time"" and ""interaction"". This exploration of timing and participation provides me with new inspiration on how to construct interactive experience in the final project.",123.png,456.png,Symbiosis,,,"interactive media, gen art",

The pixelated elements in the poster provide inspiration for my project 2C, in which I blend the background of ""The Matrix"" into the web design, which makes the page full of a strong sense of technology and futurism.",symphony-in-acid-7.png,symphony-in-acid-6.png,Max Cooper – Symphony in Acid,,https://ksawerykomputery.com/works/max-cooper-symphony-in-acid,"interactive media, gen art",
